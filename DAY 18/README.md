## ✅ Features

- Real-time webcam monitoring
- Detects fire-like colors (orange, yellow)
- Draws bounding boxes around flame regions
- Lightweight and fast

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python fire_detector.py
```

- Keep a flame or video of fire in front of the webcam
- Press `q` to quit

---

## 📌 Tips

- Works best in dark or normal lighting
- Can be extended with CNN or alarm system
- Use thermal camera or IR data for industrial use cases
