# 👁️ Day 3: Computer Vision Basics with OpenCV

This project demonstrates basic computer vision techniques using Python and OpenCV.

## 📂 Files

- `image_processor.py`: Loads an image, converts to grayscale, and applies edge detection.
- `video_processor.py`: Captures webcam video, processes it in real time.
- `sample.jpg`: Add your own image file in the same directory.

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

2. To run the image processor:

```bash
python image_processor.py
```

3. To run the webcam video processor:

```bash
python video_processor.py
```

Press `q` to quit the webcam window.

## 🛠 Features

- Image and video processing
- Grayscale conversion
- Canny edge detection
