ADVANCED FACE DETUCTION AND TRACKING.

	*IS A COMP TECHNOLOGY BEING USED IN A VARITY OF APPLICATION THAT IDENTIFIES HUMAN 
FACE IN A DIGITAL IMAGE OR VIDEO.

HAAR CASCADE FRONTALFACE ALGORITHM.

	BESED ON THE HAAR WAVELET TECHNIQUES TO ANALYZE PIXELS IN THE IMG INTO 
SQUARES BY FUNCTION

	THIS USES ML TECHNIQUES TO GET A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURECY FROM WHAT IS CALLED 
"TRAINING DATA".



DETECTMULTISCALE:

#FACES = FACE_CASCADE.DETECTMULTISCALE(src,scalefactor,minNeighbors)

faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(img,1.3,4)
